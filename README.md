===========

David, David, David (Joe) and David's (Jamie) game, for the Warwick February 48 hour competition. With theme 'time'.

We are using [David's (Joe) game library](https://github.com/ikn/pygame-template).

Dependencies
------------

* Python (2.6 or later 2.x)
* Pygame (1.8 or later, probably; tested with 1.9.1)

Running
-------

To run from source, you must first compile.  This process requires GNU Make or equivalent, and header files for SDL and Pygame must be available on the system.  Just run

    make

Now, on systems with a sh-compatible shell, do

    ./run

On other systems (Windows, for example), run game.py with your Python 2 executable.
