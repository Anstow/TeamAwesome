TeamAwesome
===========

David, David, David (Joe) and David's (Jamie) game, for the Warwick February 48 hour competition. With theme 'time'.

We are using [David's (Joe) game library](https://github.com/ikn/pygame-template).

Dependencies
------------

* Python (2.6 or later 2.x)
* Pygame (1.8 or later, probably; tested with 1.9.1)

Running
-------

To run from source, you must first compile.  This process requires GNU Make or equivalent or the version of Visual whatever-it's-called that was used to compile your Python version, and header files for SDL and Pygame must be available on the system.  Just run

    make

On Windows, this requires the command-line compiler ('cl') to be on your path, and assumes that SDL.h is in the directory 'sdl_include' above this directory (horrible, I know).

Now, on systems with a sh-compatible shell, do

    ./run

On other systems (Windows, for example), run run.py with your Python 2 executable.

Controls
--------

F10: minimise
